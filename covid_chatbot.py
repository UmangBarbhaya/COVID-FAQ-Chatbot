SARS emerged at the end of 2002 in China, and it caused more than 8 000 cases in 33 countries over a period of eight months. Around one in ten of the people who developed SARS died. As of 30 March 2020, the COVID-19 outbreak had caused over 700 000 cases worldwide since the first case was reported in China in January 2020. Of these, more than 30 000 are known to have died. While the viruses that cause both COVID-19 and seasonal influenza are transmitted from person-to-person and may cause similar symptoms, the two viruses are very different and do not behave in the same way."
#   
#   utter_covidintent20:
#   - text: "While animals are believed to be the original source, the virus spread is now from person to person (human-to-human transmission). There is not enough epidemiological information at this time to determine how easily this virus spreads between people, but it is currently estimated that, on average, one infected person will infect between two and three other people. The virus seems to be transmitted mainly via small respiratory droplets through sneezing, coughing, or when people interact with each other for some time in close proximity (usually less than one metre). These droplets can then be inhaled, or they can land on surfaces that others may come into contact with, who can then get infected when they touch their nose, mouth or eyes. The virus can survive on different surfaces from several hours (copper, cardboard) up to a few days (plastic and stainless steel). However, the amount of viable virus declines over time and may not always be present in sufficient numbers to cause infection. The incubation period for COVID-19 (i.e. the time between exposure to the virus and onset of symptoms) is currently estimated to bet between one and 14 days. We know that the virus can be transmitted when people who are infected show symptoms such as coughing. There is also some evidence suggesting that transmission can occur from a person that is infected even two days before showing symptoms; however, uncertainties remain about the effect of transmission by  non-symptomatic persons."

It seems that pregnant women appear to experience similar clinical manifestations as non-pregnant women who have progressed to COVID-19 pneumonia and to date (as of 25 March), there have been no maternal deaths, no pregnancy losses and only one stillbirth reported. No current evidence suggests that infection with COVID-19 during pregnancy has a negative effect on the foetus. At present, there is no evidence of transmission of COVID-19 from mother to baby during pregnancy and only one confirmed COVID-19 neonatal case has been reported to date. ECDC will continue to monitor the emerging scientific literature on this question, and suggests that all pregnant women follow the same general precautions for the prevention of COVID-19, including regular handwashing, avoiding individuals who are sick, and self-isolating in case of any symptoms, while consulting a healthcare provider by telephone for advice."

National authorities may decide to test only subgroups of suspected cases based on the national capacity to test, the availability of necessary equipment for testing, the level of community transmission of COVID-19, or other criteria. As a resource conscious approach, ECDC has suggested that national authorities may consider prioritising testing in the following groups: hospitalised patients with severe respiratory infections; symptomatic healthcare staff including those with mild symptoms; cases with acute respiratory infections in hospital or long-term care facilities; patients with acute respiratory infections or influenza-like illness in certain outpatient clinics or hospitals; elderly people with underlying chronic medical conditions such as lung disease, cancer, heart failure, cerebrovascular disease, renal disease, liver disease, diabetes, and immunocompromising conditions."

All these symptoms are usually referred to as hay fever, pollen allergy or more appropriately allergic rhinitis. Allergic rhinitis is commonly associated with allergic asthma in children and adults. Allergies, including mild allergic asthma, have not been identified as a major risk factor for SARS-CoV-2 infection or for a more unfavourable outcome in the studies available so far. Moderate to severe asthma on the other hand, where patients need treatment daily, is included in the chronic lung conditions that predispose to severe disease. Children and adults on maintenance medication for allergies (e.g. leukotriene inhibitors, inhaled corticosteroids and/or bronchodilators) need to continue their treatment as prescribed by their doctor and should not discontinue their medication due to fears of COVID-19. If they develop symptoms compatible with COVID-19, they will need to self-isolate, inform their doctor and monitor their health as everyone else. If progressive difficulty breathing develops, they should seek prompt medical assistance."

#   - text: "Physical distancing aims to reduce physical contact between potentially infected people and healthy people, or between population groups with high rates of transmission and others with low or no level of transmission. The objective of this is to decrease or interrupt the spread of COVID-19. Note that the term ‘physical distancing’ means the same thing as the widely used term ‘social distancing’, but it more accurately describes what is intended, namely that people keep physically apart. Physical distancing measures might be implemented over an extended period and their success depends on ensuring that people maintain social contact – from a distance – with friends, family and colleagues. Internet-based communications and the phone are therefore key tools for ensuring a successful physical distancing strategy."

On the other hand there is no evidence that face masks will effectively prevent you from becoming infected with the virus. In fact, it is possible that the use of face masks may even increase the risk of infection due to a false sense of security and increased contact between hands, mouth and eyes while wearing them. The inappropriate use of masks also may increase the risk of infection."

The first, involving a few dozen healthy volunteers, tests the vaccine for safety, monitoring for adverse effects. The second, involving several hundred people, usually in a part of the world badly affected by the disease, looks at how effective the vaccine is in the field, and the third does the same in several thousand people."

However, they can be infected as easily as adults, though the extent to which children play a role in the transmission of the virus to others is still uncertain. Depending on local circumstances, local authorities may decide to temporarily close schools and day care centres to reduce transmission in the community. However, school closures may have an impact on availability of healthcare staff and other essential services, due to the need for having to  care for their children when not in school, which needs to be taken into consideration (e.g. some countries only maintain schooling for these children of staff in a critical role). Also, if grandparents are asked to care for the children, the benefits of lower transmission between children might be offset by transmission into a more vulnerable population group. Wherever school closure happens, it is important that parents and caregivers are supported, for example by their employers applying teleworking or limited office shift schedules, so they can stay at home more and take care of their children."

Exceptions are also foreseen for travellers with an essential function or need. In addition, most EU countries have also applied national borders closure and/or border checks and travel and transport restrictions or bans within their national borders and between different regions as a measure to slow the spread.

It should be emphasised that older people and those with underlying health conditions should take these precautionary measures very seriously.

#   - text: "The diversion of healthcare resources to manage the COVID-19 crisis has significantly affected the ability of many health systems to maintain standards of care for patients with other medical conditions. Hospitals in the worst-affected countries are struggling to keep pace with the number of admissions from the corona virus alone, and have almost zero capacity to cope with other conditions. Even in countries that are not as badly affected, many hospitals have now deferred elective surgeries, redirected any upper respiratory tract infection or pneumonia cases to isolation wards, and cancelled or postponed non-critical outpatient clinic visits. This also means that people are deferring their health checks, including screening tests to pick up cancer incidence. The latter in particular means there will be patients who would otherwise have been identified through routine screening as being in need of urgent medical attention, and these are now missed or delayed – which means the window of opportunity for seeking early or effective treatment may be closed, resulting in morbidity or mortality that could have been avoided. The situation may be compounded when the supply chains for essential medicines are disrupted, a reality that is starting to happen in several countries which are key producers of medical supplies."

In the past 15 years alone, outbreaks of Zika, MERS-CoV, SARS, cholera, tuberculosis, HIV/AIDS, influenza and Ebola have killed hundreds of thousands of people. We know why this is happening. We live in a world where humans are increasingly connected — not only to each other but also to animals, which are responsible for about three-quarters of new infectious diseases. What’s more, human beings are moving around the planet faster than at any other time in history, giving pathogens endless opportunities to find new hosts, cross borders and evolve into stronger strains than we’ve seen in the past. Climate change is also fuelling the spread of disease, as warmer temperatures disrupt our ecological balance and expand the habitats of mosquitoes and other disease-carrying species. Meanwhile, antimicrobial resistance is undermining some of the gains we have made in controlling outbreaks, as infections become more difficult — and even impossible — to kill. The next pandemic is only a matter of time. And as has become painfully obvious over these past few weeks, we remain dangerously underprepared."

More severe symptoms such as pneumonia, seem to be appear to be more common in older people those with weakened immune systems or long-term conditions.

Emerging evidence suggests that transmission from mother to baby during pregnancy or birth (vertical transmission) is probable. There has been a report of a single case in which this appears likely, but reassuringly the baby was discharged from hospital and is well. In all previously reported cases, infection was found at least 30 hours after birth. It is important to emphasise that in all reported cases of newborn babies developing coronavirus very soon after birth, the baby was well. Given current evidence, it is considered unlikely that if you have the virus it would cause problems with the babys development, and none have been observed currently. Some babies born to women with symptoms of coronavirus in China have been born prematurely. It is unclear whether coronavirus caused early labour, or whether it was recommended that the baby was born early in order to preserve the mothers health. The UK is conducting near-real-time surveillance (observation) of all women who develop COVID-19 during pregnancy and their newborn babies, through well-established systems already used by all maternity units.

What we do know is that pregnancy in a small proportion of women can alter how your body handles severe viral infections. This is something that midwives and obstetricians have known for many years and are used to dealing with. As yet, there is no evidence that pregnant women who get coronavirus are more at risk of serious complications than any other healthy individuals.

A caesarean may be recommended as a planned (elective) procedure, for medical reasons, or as an emergency, for example if doctors and midwives are concerned that your baby is not coping with labour and needs to be born immediately. Furthermore, around one in five women in the UK has an instrumental birth; some of these may also be recommended to occur in an operating theatre in order to allow the team to modify plans and undertake a caesarean birth if necessary.Most caesareans and instrumental births in theatre are carried out under spinal or epidural anaesthetic, which means youll be awake, but the lower part of your body is numb and you cannot feel any pain. In this situation, everything will be done by the clinical staff - midwives, obstetricians and anaesthetists - to keep your birth partner with you.Due to the coronavirus pandemic, staff in the operating theatre will be wearing enhanced personal protective equipment (PPE) to prevent the spread of infection, which will make it more difficult for them to communicate. To enable the clinicians to assist in the birth of your baby safely, its really important your birth partner follows the instructions from the maternity team carefully and quickly.Occasionally, a general anaesthetic (where youre put to sleep) may be used, particularly if your baby needs to be born urgently. During this type of caesarean birth, even under more routine circumstances, for safety reasons it is not recommended for the birth partner to be present during the birth.While the maternity team will do all they can to ensure that your partner is present for the birth, there will be some occasions when there is a need for an urgent emergency birth with epidural or spinal anaesthetic, and it is not possible for your partner to be present. This is because during an emergency operating theatres are more high risk environments in terms of potential spread of coronavirus to everyone who is present.If it is the case that your partner will not be able to be present during the birth, your maternity team will explain this to you and will do everything they can to ensure that your partner can see you and your baby as soon as possible after the birth."

This means it could contaminate the water, causing infection to pass to the baby. It may also be more difficult for healthcare staff to use adequate protection equipment during a water birth.There is no evidence that women with suspected or confirmed coronavirus cannot have an epidural or a spinal block. In our previous version of the guidance it was suggested that the use of Entonox (gas and air) may increase aerosolisation and spread of the virus, but a review of the evidence suggests there is no evidence that Entonox is an aerosol-prone procedure, so there is no reason you cannot use this in labour."

More recently the virus has also been detected in asymptomatic persons.How long someone is actively sick can vary so the decision on when to release someone from isolation is made using a test-based or non-test-based strategy (i.e. time since illness started and time since recovery) in consultation with state and local public health officials. The decision involves considering the specifics of each situation, including disease severity, illness signs and symptoms, and the results of laboratory testing for that patient.Learn more about CDCs guidance on when to release someone from isolation and discharge hospitalized patients with COVID-19.

Although there have not been reports of pets or other animals becoming sick with COVID-19, it is still recommended that people sick with COVID-19 limit contact with animals until more information is known about the new coronavirus. When possible, have another member of your household care for your animals while you are sick. If you are sick with COVID-19, avoid contact with your pet, including petting, snuggling, being kissed or licked, and sharing food. If you must care for your pet or be around animals while you are sick, wash your hands before and after you interact with pets. Global health organizations are monitoring the outbreaks potential impact on animal health and will notify the public if new information becomes available."

In humans, several coronaviruses are knownto cause respiratory infections ranging from the common cold to moresevere diseases such as Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS)and Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS). The most recentlydiscovered coronavirus causes coronavirus disease COVID-19."

#   - text: "The most common symptoms of COVID-19 are fever, tiredness, anddry cough. Some patients may have aches and pains, nasalcongestion, runny nose, sore throat or diarrhea. These symptoms areusually mild and begin gradually. Some people become infected butdont develop any symptoms and dont feel unwell. Most people(about 80%) recover from the disease without needing specialtreatment. Around 1 out of every 6 people who gets COVID-19becomes seriously ill and develops difficulty breathing. Older people,and those with underlying medical problems like high blood pressure,heart problems or diabetes, are more likely to develop serious illness.People with fever, cough and difficulty breathing should seek medicalattention."

#   - text: "People can catch COVID-19 from others who have the virus. Thedisease can spread from person to person through small droplets fromthe nose or mouth which are spread when a person with COVID-19coughs or exhales. These droplets land on objects and surfacesaround the person. Other people then catch COVID-19 by touchingthese objects or surfaces, then touching their eyes, nose or mouth.People can also catch COVID-19 if they breathe in droplets from aperson with COVID-19 who coughs out or exhales droplets. This iswhy it is important to stay more than 1 meter (3 feet) away from aperson who is sick."

# 
#   utter_covidintent186:
#   - text: "The main way the disease spreads is through respiratory dropletsexpelled by someone who is coughing. The risk of catching COVID-19from someone with no symptoms at all is very low. However, manypeople with COVID-19 experience only mild symptoms. This isparticularly true at the early stages of the disease. It is thereforepossible to catch COVID-19 from someone who has, for example, justa mild cough and does not feel ill."
# 
#   utter_covidintent187:
#   - text: "The risk of catching COVID-19 from the feces of an infected personappears to be low. While initial investigations suggest the virus maybe present in feces in some cases, spread through this route is not a main feature of the outbreak. The ongoing research on the waysCOVID-19 is spread and will continue to share new findings. Becausethis is a risk, however, it is another reason to clean hands regularly,after using the bathroom and before eating."

Manycountries around the world have seen cases of COVID-19 and severalhave seen outbreaks. Authorities in China and some other countrieshave succeeded in slowing or stopping their outbreaks. However, thesituation is unpredictable so check regularly for the latest news.You can reduce your chances of being infected or spreading COVID19 by taking some simple precautions:_ Regularly and thoroughly clean your hands with an alcoholbased hand rub or wash them with soap and water.Why? Washing your hands with soap and water or usingalcohol-based hand rub kills viruses that may be on your hands._ Maintain at least 1 metre (3 feet) distance between yourself andanyone who is coughing or sneezing.Why? When someone coughs or sneezes they spray small liquiddroplets from their nose or mouth which may contain virus. If youare too close, you can breathe in the droplets, including theCOVID-19 virus if the person coughing has the disease._ Avoid touching eyes, nose and mouth.Why? Hands touch many surfaces and can pick up viruses.Once contaminated, hands can transfer the virus to your eyes,nose or mouth. From there, the virus can enter your body andcan make you sick._ Make sure you, and the people around you, follow goodrespiratory hygiene. This means covering your mouth and nosewith your bent elbow or tissue when you cough or sneeze. Then dispose of the used tissue immediately.Why? Droplets spread virus. By following good respiratoryhygiene you protect the people around you from viruses such ascold, flu and COVID-19._ Stay home if you feel unwell. If you have a fever, cough anddifficulty breathing, seek medical attention and call in advance.Follow the directions of your local health authority.Why? National and local authorities will have the most up to dateinformation on the situation in your area. Calling in advance willallow your health care provider to quickly direct you to the righthealth facility. This will also protect you and help prevent spreadof viruses and other infections._ Keep up to date on the latest COVID-19 hotspots (cities or localareas where COVID-19 is spreading widely). If possible, avoidtraveling to places - especially if you are an older person orhave diabetes, heart or lung disease.Why? You have a higher chance of catching COVID-19 in one ofthese areas."

#   - text: "The risk depends on where you are - and more specifically, whetherthere is a COVID-19 outbreak unfolding there.For most people in most locations the risk of catching COVID-19 isstill low. However, there are now places around the world (cities orareas) where the disease is spreading. For people living in, or visiting,these areas the risk of catching COVID-19 is higher. Governmentsand health authorities are taking vigorous action every time a newcase of COVID-19 is identified. Be sure to comply with any localrestrictions on travel, movement or large gatherings. Cooperating withdisease control efforts will reduce your risk of catching or spreadingCOVID-19.COVID-19 outbreaks can be contained and transmission stopped, ashas been shown in China and some other countries. Unfortunately,new outbreaks can emerge rapidly. Its important to be aware of thesituation where you are or intend to go."

However, it can cause serious illness:about 1 in every 5 people who catch it need hospital care. It istherefore quite normal for people to worry about how the COVID-19outbreak will affect them and their loved ones.We can channel our concerns into actions to protect ourselves, ourloved ones and our communities. First and foremost among theseactions is regular and thorough hand-washing and good respiratoryhygiene.

Before touching the mask, clean hands with an alcohol-based hand rub or soap and water 3. Take the mask and inspect it for tears or holes. 4. Orient which side is the top side (where the metal strip is). 5. Ensure the proper side of the mask faces outwards (the coloured side). 6. Place the mask to your face. Pinch the metal strip or stiff edge of the mask so it moulds to the shape of your nose. 7. Pull down the masks bottom so it covers your mouth and your chin. 8. After use, take off the mask; remove the elastic loops from behind the ears while keeping the mask away from your face and clothes, to avoid touching potentially contaminated surfaces of the mask. 9. Discard the mask in a closed bin immediately after use. 10. Perform hand hygiene after touching or discarding the mask - Use alcohol-based hand rub or, if visibly soiled, wash your hands with soap and water."

For example, SARS-CoV was associated with civet cats and MERS-CoV is transmitted by dromedary camels. Possible animal sources of COVID-19 have not yet been confirmed. To protect yourself, such as when visiting live animal markets, avoid direct contact with animals and surfaces in contact with animals. Ensure good food safety practices at all times. Handle raw meat, milk or animal organs with care to avoid contamination of uncooked foods and avoid consuming raw or undercooked animal products."

Studies suggest that corona viruses (including preliminary information on the COVID-19 virus) may persist on surfaces for a few hours or up to several days. This may vary under different conditions (e.g. type of surface, temperature or humidity of the environment). If you think a surface may be infected, clean it with simple disinfectant to kill the virus and protect yourself and others. Clean your hands with  an alcohol-based hand rub or wash them with soap and water. Avoid touching your eyes, mouth, or nose."

#   - text: "Wearing masks does more to protect others against the disease if you have it, rather than protect you from the disease if you come into contact with others who have it. More than that, high demand for masks from individuals deprives those who might need them more, such as healthcare workers. So, if you suspect you have a respiratory ailment, do wear a mask. If you feel OK, dont.The government is following the instructions of the WHO carefully and every level of public health machinery is aligned to it. The ministry of health is constantly updated about the numbers of cases and provides instructions to doctors and hospitals regarding the isolation and treatment of patients with the disease."
# 
#   utter_covidintent203:
#   - text: "The government has stopped the entry of people from countries affected by this disease by cancelling visas. Those who are suspected of having the disease are being tested. Quarantine facilities have been put into place in multiple locations. Ideally, a mechanism for testing anyone who suspects they have the disease should be put in place, but this is yet to happen. Much will depend on how matters unfold in the near future. If there is what is called ?community transmission of the coronavirus, the numbers of those affected may become simply too large for the public health apparatus in India to cope with. It is for this reason that pursuing physical distancing, tracking down cases, the use of self-quarantine and monitoring of those who might develop symptoms later is crucial at this point."

A number of Indian newspapers have carried accurate and well-researched reporting on the coronavirus and can be trusted. A good idea is always to go to the original source, typically the WHO or the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare which has current advisories."
